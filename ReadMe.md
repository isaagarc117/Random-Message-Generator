# Random Message Generator

This program generates a fortune message much like those found in fortune cookies. 

## The final output of the program contains 3 parts:
+ A fortune quote.
+ A statement recommending which color to wear for increased luck.
+ A set of lucky numbers.

An output example would look like: 

Goodness is the only investment that never fails.
Dress in purple to increase your luck
Lucky Numbers: 83, 6, 96, 77, 55

The three outputs are stored as properties of a fortune object. A fortune message is generated by iterating through the object's properties. 

### Fortune quote
The quote component is retrieved from an array of quotes. A random number is used as the index of the array to return a random quote. 

### Color
The color component works much like the quote. There is an array containing colors from which we obtain a value by using a random index. 

### Lucky Numbers
A function generates the n specified amount of random lucky numbers, which are stored in an array and subsequently translated into a formatted string.
